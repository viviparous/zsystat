= Objective = 

To monitor connexions created by Web browsing. I wanted a simple-as-possible solution to 
run in a Linux terminal so I could copy/paste the IP addresses and research the infrastructure.

I wanted a maintainable solution that I could extend easily. For better or for worse, *this is all shell programming*. (^;

= How To Use =

Save the Bash file to disk, run the file in a terminal.

I run zsystat in a _foot_ terminal in Wayland. The _foot_ terminal makes it possible to reduce the font size 
of one terminal window without affecting the font size in other _foot_ windows. 

*Conky* is a much prettier project but zsystat gives me the functionality that I want. 

= Features =

* show IP addresses for cennexions being created (can copy using mouse)
* network activity (transmit and receive)
* CPU core usage and process affinity
* RAM and swap

## = Purpose = 

This project began as a tool to monitor connexions created by Web browsing. I wanted a simple-as-possible solution to 
run in a Linux terminal so I could copy/paste the IP addresses and research the infrastructure.

I wanted a solution that I could change and extend easily. For better or for worse, *this is all shell programming*. (^;

## =How To Use =

Save the Bash file to disk. In a terminal, apply chmod to give permission to execute. Run the Bash script.

The default interval is 15 seconds.

I run zsystat in a _foot_ terminal in Wayland. The _foot_ terminal makes it possible to reduce the font size 
of one terminal window without affecting the font size in other _foot_ windows. 

*Conky* is a much prettier project. I like Conky too. 

## = Features =

* show IP addresses for connexions being created (can copy using mouse)
* network activity (transmit and receive)
* CPU core usage and process affinity
* RAM and swap
